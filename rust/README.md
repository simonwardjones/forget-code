## Exploration

To make a new cargo package folder
```shell
cargo new <folder-name>
```

To run any of the sub-folders e.g. `control-flow` use
```shell
cargo run -p control-flow
```

To build them all to `target` folder use `cargo build`

## Notes

For summary see `rust-summary.md`


## Vscode

I turned variable type hints off unless `option`+`control` pressed
