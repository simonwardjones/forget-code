    "If we have a product or service that works in a certain way we often want to make changes to improve this. When we make a change we want to be able to say that the impact is real and in the right direction. In order to be able to measure this change we can use AB testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an AB test we split the users into different groups; the control group stays with the same experience or product and then the other groups each receive a variation of this (often there is only one other variant). We then measure key metrics for each group and compare the results. AB testing can be used in many fields but is often used in product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more concrete for the rest of the article - imagine we are running a website and are looking to improve the conversion of users purchasing on our website. We want to run an AB test to see if changing the styling of a key product page increases the number of users converting. The users are randomly split into two groups, we show the control group the old website and we show the users in the variant group the modified styling. We run the test for a period of time and observe how many from each group go on to purchase - we then calculate the statistics to determine whether the conversion rate has improved for the new style.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use AB testing for other metrics such as average spend but the analysis is a little different.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the statistics for an AB test there are two main schools of thought - `Freqentist` and `Bayesian`"
